### 🚀 About Me

I’m a highly motivated developer with a strong foundation in coding and a deep curiosity for how real-world systems are built and scaled. While I may not have followed a conventional path of excelling in academics or extracurriculars, I found my strength in problem-solving through code—and since then, I’ve been continuously learning by building, experimenting, and contributing.

I thrive in environments that value learning, collaboration, and impact. I enjoy working across different parts of the stack, understanding systems end-to-end, and adapting quickly to new technologies. I bring an experimental mindset, persistence, and a genuine passion for open source—where learning happens in public and contributions matter.

My goal is to work with mentors and teams that are solving meaningful problems, contribute consistently to open-source communities, and grow into an engineer who can create scalable, reliable, and future-ready software. In the age of AI, I aim to stand out not just by using tools, but by deeply understanding systems, writing clean code, and continuously pushing my limits.

I’m actively seeking internship and open-source opportunities (including GSoC) where I can learn fast, contribute value, and grow alongside experienced engineers.

### 🏍️ Fun Facts

- I wasn’t great at sports, music, or academics—but I can spend hours debugging a single issue and still enjoy it.
- I learn best by breaking things first, then fixing them (that’s how most of my real learning happens).
- I’m more excited about a merged pull request than a certificate or trophy.
- Love travelling solo.
